This class handles the main method and all associated functions with the main execution space -- it shouldn't be touched by other classes.

Items:
    private JFrame jf;
    private JPanel contentPane;
    
    private Program();
    private void init();
    
    
    
jf is our main JFrame, where most of the project takes place.
contentpane is our actual space where content is added -- It does our management of searches, results, etc. It's in a JPanel so we can have other things in the top bar.
